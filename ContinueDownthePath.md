Ignoring the leaf, you continue down the path. The wind whistling through the trees unnerves you a bit, so you look around for a stick or something to carry with you. 

##### INVENTORY
1 Stick

Stick in hand, you feel a bit safer (and a bit silly) and continue on your way. 

You walk for about half a mile, and your mind starts to wander. Suddenly, a rustling noise to your left snaps your focus back to the woods. You see a small figure, about two feet high, dashing off into the deep woods. You can hear a faint sound of something vaguely reminscent of the clacking of a keyboard, and a faint peal of laughter.
