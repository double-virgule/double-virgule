Your footsteps are muffled as you walk along the soft loam of the forest floor. A path is clearly cut through the trees, but by who or to where, you aren't sure. A soft warm breeze blows through the large weeping willows around you, and their long chains of leaves rustle with an almost harmonious tone. One of the thin leaves breaks free of the branch and flutters to your feet. Even without picking it up, you can see the veins form a tangle of characters.
