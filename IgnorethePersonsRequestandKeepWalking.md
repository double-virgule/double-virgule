"Not my problem", you think, turning around and continuing down the beach. You grit your teeth as the shouting gets louder, then turns to screams, then silence. Resisting the urge to turn around, you put one foot in front of the next, toes digging into the sand. 

The beach stretches on before you, seemingly without end. You ponder returning to the forest, but then spy a slight curve in the beach up ahead. 

The forest on your left gives way to rock, and soon, a rocky cliff is rising out of the sand next to you, cutting it off as an option, and perhaps, you think, an avenue of escape. The curve of the beach continues to increase, and soon, you're rounding the corner, having seemingly found the edge of the apparent island you've found yourself on. 

You plod around the corner, and discover two pirates standing waist-deep in a hole, a large pile of sand nearby. A treasure chest is clearly visible in the hole, and one of them is fiddling with the lock. The other sees you and shouts, "Hey, you, don't come any closer! This treasure is ours!" He draws an old-style pistol and points it at you, backing his threat. 

You take a look at them, and notice their clothes are a patchwork of charts, graphs and data points, stitched over a cloth covered in code. The pirate notices you squinting at them and says, "What are you looking at? We're the Programming Pirates, of course our favorite language is R! Now git"
