You stoop down to pick up the brownish-yellow leaf, and as you draw closer, your eyes focus on the words grown on both sides. A Powershell function so poorly formed that even a cursory glance can tell it would cause dozens of errors. A do/while loop that never ends due to an uncaught variable. A long string of parentheses, never closed. 

You step back in horror, but the leaf is stuck to your fingers. You wave your hand to dislodge it, gently at first, but then harder, and harder, until you lose your footing on the mossy undergrowth and stumble into the trunk of one of the nearby trees. The long draping branches catch your clothes, and the leaves stick to you, seeming to leap off the branches onto your clothes, arms, hands, and face. You claw at them, catching glimpses of undeclared variables, mismatched data types, and the dreaded self-referential function. 

You stagger back out of the woods hours later, leaves still stuck in your hair and to your clothes, muttering to yourself that "code documentation is only for people who don't know what they're doing" and "version control is only necessary for poor coders." Not even the Sages of the Sacred Repo can save you now. 

Your coding career is over before it truly began.
