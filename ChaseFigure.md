You sprint after the figure, dodging low-hanging branches and thick roots. After a few minutes, you start to feel winded. The figure is no closer to you than when you started chasing it. You pause, resting against a tree, hearing that somehow familiar clattering fade into the distance, then disappear altogether. After a few more breaths, you turn around to return to the path, but all you see is trees. The sun is barely visible overhead, and only now do you realize how dark this part of the woods is. 

Your stomach tightens as the realization hits you: You're lost. Trying to stay calm, you begin walking back in what you think is the direction you came. Suddenly, the figure you were chasing before drops down in front of you, hanging by its knees from a tree-branch. It is at eye level with you, and its long scraggly beard drapes, inverted, over its face. Hanging around its waist and chest is a bandolier and belt of computer keys. As it sways in the wind, you hear the familar rattling of the keys. 

It reaches up and parts its beard, and you can see two yellowish eyes peering out at you below a crooked nose. "I fere you are loost, boye!" You struggle to understand the words at first, thinking it must have some sort of accent. It taps the keys around its chest, and the words repeat. "U arr loust, myi boye. Lostt in th lande of typose." 

It drops to the ground, somersaulting so it lands on its feet, and peers up at you. It can't be more than two feet tall, but it stares up at you. "Noo une retrns froim th Forst of Tipoes. Unlsss I hlp yee. Butt their is a kostt." 

He plucks one of the keys from his bandolier and holds it out to you. "Teke thi keey, und ti whill leed u frum th forsest. but uou wiel nevr typi withot tyipoes a';gain."
