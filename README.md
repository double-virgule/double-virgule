## Welcome!
If you've stumbled your way here, you're either very lost or very desperate. This is not a place you should be looking for any sort of coding help. I am not a programmer by any means, just a script monkey who has a deep knowledge of Powershell, a passing familarity with Python, and has occasionally opened a Visual Studio project with some C# in it. (Fun fact, I got rejected from an advanced programming course in college because I got C++ and C# mixed up while on a call with the head of the program. They very loudly told me "C## isn't a language!", hung up the phone, and that was that.) 

### Choose Your Path
