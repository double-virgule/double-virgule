You brandish your stick and take off running at the pirates, screaming at the top of your lungs. 

The pirate is momentarily taken aback, but recovers and shoots you. The round impacts you square in the chest, and you fall down, snapping your stick under you. 

The pirate walks over and stands over you, shaking his head. 

"Should have known better than to challenge a Programming Pirate to a fight. I was able to plot your every move from a mile away." 

The world starts to go dark as they lift the chest out of the hole and roll you in. 

You have died on the beach.
