You think about spending the rest of your life fixing errors that spawn solely from typos, shudder, and shake your head. The figure shrugs, and pressed the key back into its bandolier. It speaks clearly for the first time, careful punching the keys on its chest. "You will regret that." It vanishes back into the trees, and you are left alone, in the darkening woods. 

You look up and get a glint of sunlight, and decide to follow it east. As you walk, you hum to yourself, trying to distract yourself from the occasional rattling of leaves in the trees, from the wind that whispers past your ears, echoing the final words of the creature. The woods grow, somehow, even darker, and you realize the sun must have set. Desperate, you peer around for the moon through the thick canopy, for some sort of light, but the forest around you is as black as pitch. You step forward, haltingly, holding out your hands in front of you, feeling for the next tree. 

To your left, you hear a disturbance on the forest floor. You freeze and tilt your head, and try to hone in on the noise. It happens again, a long and drawn out hiss of leaves, as though someone or something was dragging something heavy through the leaves. Eyes as open as wide as you can make them, you squat down against a tree, making yourself as small as possible, praying whatever it is will pass you by. There is another hiss, and then you see a faint red glow about twenty feet in the direction of the noise. Another hiss, and the glow gets closer. You still can't make out any details, but whatever it is has buried itself under a thick canopy of leaves. You ready your stick, but almost too fast for you to see, a squiggly red line bursts from the underbrush and wraps itself around you. You feel...wrong, as though your innards are being remade. The monstrous red line hisses again, and you can make out words within: "Ssssssssssssssssspellllll cheeccccccckkkk". 

You lose consciousness as the Spell Check Snake finishes correcting the spelling within your DNA. 

You have died in the woods.
