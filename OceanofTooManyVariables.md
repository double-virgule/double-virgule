Instead of heading into the forest, you decide a stroll along the beach is more your speed. You enjoy the fresh cool breeze blowing in from the ocean, and the sound of your feet crunching gently on the sand. As you walk, you notice the sand has an odd texture, but your eyes can't see what it is without some sort of magnification. You drop the sand and continue on, walking along this deserted stretch of beach. The forest is 500 yards or so inland, then becomes the scrubby bushes of the interstitial space between sand and trees. The sun moves overhead, and you feel its heat intensify. The breeze turns warm, and the walk stops being as pleasant. 

You stop, suddenly, as you hear a shout. You turn, trying to orient to it, and realize it's coming from the ocean. Putting your hand up to shield your eyes, you can just make out a humanoid figure paddling toward you with great urgency on a canoe, its bow low enough in the water that you assume it is taking on water. The sun drifts behind a cloud, and the reflection on the water dims, and you can suddenly see why the figure is panicked. The waters behind them are absolutely clogged with the pinkish forms of jellyfish. 

Each undulating wave bobs more of the thin domes closer to the figure. Their paddle hits a jellyfish, launching it toward the shore, where it splats and skitters to your feet. You jump back to avoid the tentacles--they must be at least four feet long--and you notice something floating inside. Before you can look closer, the figure has finally drawn close enough that their shout becomes intelligible:

"Throw me the rope! THROW ME THE ROPE!" 

You look over where they're pointing and see a small shed tucked into the scrub brush a few yards down the beach. You run over and tug on the door, but it's locked. There's a small window on the door that would probably let you reach the lock on the inside if you smashed it.

Do you: 

#### Break the Window ðŸªŸ

#### Kick the Door Down ðŸšª

#### Pick the Lock ðŸ”‘

#### Ignore the Person's Request and Keep Walking ðŸš¶
